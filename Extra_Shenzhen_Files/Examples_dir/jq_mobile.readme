Instead of writing one application for each mobile device or OS:
Android and Blackberry is written in Java
iOS is written in Objective C
Windows Phone is written in C# and .net, etc.
jQuery Mobile solves this problem, as it only uses HTML, CSS and JavaScript, which is standard for all mobile web browsers!
